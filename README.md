> # An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

An analysis was performed on Kickstarter data to uncover trends related to theaters as well as failed and successful campaigns launched in the US.  Additional research was also conducted on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to show how successful five of the plays where and how they where funded. 

# Analysis 

Through the analysis of the data presented in the Kickstarter set, it can be determined that Theater's have a more steady success rate compared to Technology or Musicals.

When looking at the data on Theater campaign's over years, you can see a large spike in successful campaigns happens in May. Theater success starts to increase in March reaching its peak in May, then a steady decrease thought the end of the year.

Compared to Technology over years, the data is all over the place. While the successful Technology campaigns remains between 10 and 25, so does failed campaigns with a small drop in April.

For the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, all five plays went over their goal. Cutting off Date Bush was the one with the most pledged, going over the goal by 1076 with only 78 backers. All five plays were very successful and could be considered for future campaigns. Although having a goal around 2000 would be an idea target area. 

# Recommendations

Based on the research, you should focus more on Theater campaigns from March through May and expect successful campaigns to start to decrease through out the rest of the year. This would allow you to focus on more profitable campaigns during the later part of the year such as Music which has a high success and more stable out come. While Photograph could be a focus in the last quarter when successful campaigns pick up. 

For your Edinburgh Festival Fringe I would recommend trying to get the campaign goal under 4000. The median range for goals  out of the five chosen is 2000, which means the goal of 4000 is a bit high.
